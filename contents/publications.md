My research interests include **Natural Language Processing, Multimodal Learning** among the information extraction and summary generation areas. Now my research interests include but are not limited to, how to combine knowledge graphs with large language models (LLMs), such as leveraging  LLMs to assist information extraction, or utilizing knowledge graphs to alleviate the "hallucination" problem in LLMs.
