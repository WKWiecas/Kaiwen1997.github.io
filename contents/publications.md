His research interests encompass Natural Language Processing and Multimodal Learning, with a focus on the areas of information extraction and summary generation. Currently, his interests extend to the integration of knowledge graphs with large language models (LLMs). This includes exploring methods to harness LLMs for aiding information extraction and employing knowledge graphs to mitigate the "hallucination" issue present in LLMs.
